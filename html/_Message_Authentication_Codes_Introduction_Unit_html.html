<p> 		A Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC), is a 		technique for constructing a message authentication code from a block 		cipher.  	     </p> <br/> <h3>About the experiment:</h3> <p>In the experiment we provide a "dummy" block cipher (that is just a 		function and has none of the properties of a real block cipher)  		and  ask you to use it to compute the CBC_MAC tag of an arbitrary 		message<br/> </p>
