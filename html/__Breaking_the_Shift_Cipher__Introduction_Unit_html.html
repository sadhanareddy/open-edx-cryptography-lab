<p>A private-key encryption scheme consists of a set of all possible messages, called the message space <b>M</b>, and three algorithms, namely,  		</p><ul> <li>(a) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gen</span></li> <li>(b) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enc</span></li> <li>(c) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dec</span></li> </ul> <p>The algorithm for key generation <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gen</span> is used to choose a key <b>k</b> at random from the set of all possible secert keys, denoted by the key space <b>K</b>.<br/></p> <p>The algorithm for encryption <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enc</span> takes as inputs the message <b>m</b> and the secret key <b>k</b> and outputs the ciphertext <b>c</b>.<br/></p> <p>The algorithm for decryption <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dec</span> inputs the ciphertext <b>c</b> and the key <b>k</b> and outputs the message <b>m</b>.</p> <br/> <h3>About the experiment:</h3> <p>Apparently, the system is easily broken if the total number of distinct secret keys is small, that is the key space <b>K</b> is small.<br/></p> <p> In this experiment, we work with a well-known historical encryption scheme, namely the shift cipher, that has a very small key space.<br/></p> <p> Your task is to break the shift cipher. Specifically, given (only) the ciphertext in some instance of a shift cipher, you need to find the plaintext and the secret key. </p>
