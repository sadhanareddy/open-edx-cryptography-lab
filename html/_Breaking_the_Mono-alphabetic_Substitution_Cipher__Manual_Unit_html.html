<p><b>STEP 1:</b> For the given ciphertext in the <b>PART I</b> of the experiment page, the first step is to generate ciphertext by clicking on the "Next CipherText" button.</p> <p><b>STEP 2:</b>Calculate frequencies of generated ciphertext by clicking on "Calculate Frequencies in Ciphertext" button</p> <p><b>STEP 3:</b>Copy the generated ciphertext  from <b>PART I</b> and  paste in "Scratchpad" area of <b>PART II</b></p> <p><b>STEP 4:</b>Analyse similarties between "Calculated Frequencies Table" and "English Alphabet Frequencies Table" </p> <p><b>STEP 5:</b>Based on similarities,try to make a frequency based estimation for each character of ciphertext</p> <p><b>STEP 6:</b>Replace characters of CipherText in Scratchpad with a character estimated previously using a <b>Modify</b> function of  <b>PART II</b> </p> <p><b>STEP 7:</b>Based on Hints from Ciphertext in "Scratchpad" area make more replacement of ciphertext characters</p> <p><b>STEP 8:</b>Repeat <b>Step 7</b> till you get a meaningful English Text</p><p> <b>STEP 9:</b> Finally, observe the deciphered plaintext in Scratchpad Area,if a meaningful English text is formed cut-and-paste it in the text-field named "Solution Plaintext" of <b>PART III</b>. Also enter the final character mapping in the"Solution Key" in <b>PART III</b> and click on "Check Answer" button.</p> <p><b>STEP 10[OPTIONAL]:</b> Verify that your answer is correct, by encrypting the solution plaintext with your key in <b>PART IV</b>.</p>
